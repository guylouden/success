Other Spaces
 11 June - 10 July 2016 Exhibition opens 6pm Sat 11 June 

Between the new galleries of Success, remnants of its past life as a department store persist. The Other Spaces programme will open these staff rooms, awkward architectural blind-spots, and unfinished culs de sacs for new works by Western Australian artists. Curated by Jack Wansbrough, Other Spaces invites local artists to make site-specific artwork engaging directly with these strange places and their history. 

In a narrow back-room of Success, Shannon Calcott and Graham Mathwin present I’ll Love You Tomorrow. Photographs lifted from personal archives and recent cultural history are collaged across the irregular architecture of this room. Diverse photographs look at the experience and proliferation of images at times of personal tragedy and public loss. 

Shannon Calcott’s work explores artificiality, the legacy of reproduction, and the female gaze. Graham Mathwin’s work investigates the potential of images, their power and their personal and cultural symbolic value. I’ll Love You Tomorrow forms an intimate and beguiling anthology of photography’s relation to the passing of time, and death.
