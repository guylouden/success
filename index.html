    <p>Success was an experimental contemporary art space. It transformed the basement of a defunct department store into a multi-gallery exhibition venue.
		</p>
		
    <p>Based in the historic port city of Fremantle, Western Australia, the gallery produced over 25 exhibitions featuring 90 international and Australian artists. Success was a project from the team behind Moana, an artist-run gallery established in 2012 in the Perth CBD. It was supported by the Australia Council for the Arts, the W.A. Department of Culture and the Arts, and the City of Fremantle. It presented shows through 2016, and in 2017 the venue was demolished. 
    </p>

    <p>Many people donated their precious time and expertise to make Success happen. The project was founded by Guy Louden, Dale Buckley, and Dan McCabe. They were soon joined by Lyndon Blue, Emma Buswell, Jack Wansbrough, Amber Norrish, Sophie Weedon, Guillermo Kramer, and Hannah Milk. Dozens more helped demolish, construct, paint, clean, and invigilate our nearly 3,000 square metres of gallery space.

    <p>Thank you very much to all those who put their blood, sweat, and tears into Success. ♥ Guy
