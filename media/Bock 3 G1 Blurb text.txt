Jacobus Capone: Volta 
Success, Gallery One 11 June - 10 July 2016 Exhibition opens 6pm Sat 11 June 

Volta is a personal reflection on the long psychological absence that severe depression wrought in the artist’s relationship with his father. 

In this multi channel video installation, father and son collaborated to produce an artwork as much about an act of rejoicing as it is a process of unburdening. 

Recounting childhood memories of his father fluently playing the piano accordion, Capone documents the attempt to relearn an instrument untouched since his 1998 diagnosis. Meanwhile, videos depict his immediate family’s emotional response to the interaction. 

Volta was originally commissioned by the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art for NEW16. 

Brief artist biography: 

Born in Perth, Western Australia, Jacobus Capone received his BFA from Edith Cowan University in 2007, graduating with a work that saw him cross Australia by foot, to pour water from the Indian Ocean into the Pacific (which he carried each day of the 147 day journey). 

Capone has since exhibited nationally and internationally including at Momentum Berlin, HEREart New York, ACCA, The National Portrait Gallery, Samstag Museum, Atelier Kreuzberg Berlin, and Soapbox New York. He has participated in numerous international festivals, fellowships, and residencies.
