Success, Gallery Four One night only 8pm Sat 11 June 2016 

Presenting sounds from the diverse worlds of experimental composition, dance music, free jazz, pop and beyond, Success’ live music program continues with a unique and boldly varied line-up. 

In the dedicated Gallery Four performance space, curator Lyndon Blue presents the third in the Success Sounds series, featuring Atripat, Lana, and Lee/Jacobs/ O’Connor. 

Atripat is electronic producer Michael Hewson-Bower. Inspired by classic horror film scores, his flowing minimal classical melodies express palpable apprehension and energy. Atripat’s recent EP Fibres is out on Melbourne label This Thing. 

Lana is a Perth-based experimental musician making dreamy bedroom pop informed by left-field electronics, jazz and futuristic RnB. 

Lee/Jacobs/O’Connor are an impovisational trio featuring double bassist Djuna Lee, Lenny Jacobs on drums, and Dan O’Connor on trumpet.
