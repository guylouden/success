    <p>Success was an experimental contemporary art space. It transformed the basement of a defunct department store into a multi-gallery exhibition venue.
		</p>
		
    <p>Based in the historic port city of Fremantle, Western Australia, the gallery produced over 25 exhibitions featuring 90 international and Australian artists. Success was a project from the team behind Moana, an artist-run gallery established in 2012 in the Perth CBD. It was supported by the Australia Council for the Arts, the W.A. Department of Culture and the Arts, and the City of Fremantle.
