Sarah Poulgrain: Bust Construction 

Success, Gallery Two 11 June - 10 July 2016 Exhibition opens 6pm Sat 11 June 

In Bust Construction, artist Sarah Poulgrain explores obsessive fan culture and the concept of DIY art. 

Poulgrain produced sculptures of the cast of the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. While working, she watched the show and developed techniques from viewing YouTube tutorials. 

These non-professional DIY sculptures transmit the highly personal and idiosyncratic culture of popular obsession. Acting as quasi-religious devotionals, Poulgrain’s art uncovers fandom’s emotional and spiritual nature.
